# EduTrack: Visualizing Course Sales by Continent and Topic

### Objective:
The primary objective of EduTrack is to visualize and analyze the sales performance of an organization offering classroom and online courses across different continents and topics.
  
### Scope:
The project includes the following features:
* Continent-wise Sales Visualization
* Topic-wise Sales Analysis
* Classroom vs. Online Sales Comparison
* Student Enrollment Details
* Interactive User Interface

### Methodology:
The project will be developed by using the following technologies:
* 	Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
* 	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB
* 	Other tools: Git, GitHub, and Visual Studio Code

### Proposed System:
EduTrack is a web-based application accessible across various devices with a web browser. It utilizes D3.js or a similar library to create interactive pie charts for visualizing course sales data. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database for storing course and user information.

### Features:
1.  Continent-wise Sales Visualization:
* Display pie charts showing the distribution of course sales across continents.
* Users can hover over each segment to view sales percentages and total revenue.
2. Topic-wise Sales Analysis:
* Provide separate pie charts for each course topic within the online courses category.
* Showcase the proportion of sales for each topic relative to total online/offline course sales.
3. Classroom vs. Online Sales Comparison:
* Present a comparative visualization of sales between classroom and online courses.
* Illustrate revenue share and growth trends for each vertical using graphs.
* Implement filtering options based on months and years for detailed analysis.
4. Student Enrollment Details:
* Allow users to access a detailed list of enrolled students for each course.
* Display information such as names, contact details, enrollment dates, and course progress.
5. Interactive User Interface:
* Create an intuitive user interface with interactive features such as tooltips, zooming, and filtering options.
* Enhance the user experience and facilitate data exploration.

### Implementation Plan:
1. Design database schema for courses and user enrollment.
2. Develop backend API routes for course data retrieval and user authentication.
3. Implement frontend components for displaying pie charts and student enrollment details.
4. Integrate frontend and backend components to create a seamless user experience.
